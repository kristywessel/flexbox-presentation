##Overview

This is a talk on Flexbox, a CSS layout technology that allows for much more flexible and powerful arrangement of elements than typical box model properties allow.

The talk is still under development. Check back periodically for developments.

##Running This Talk Locally

Since a local copy of [jsbin](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin) is used, there's more to viewing this project than simply cloning the repo and running it in your web browser.  You'll need to traverse into the `jsbin` directory in the project and perform some shell commands:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
bin/jsbin
```

This will run the jsbin server on localhost on port 3000.  The talk embeds iframes to fiddles relevant to the presentation.  If you run the presentation without it, all fiddle embeds will appear as text links.

##Talk Events

This presentation will be given on the following dates:

- **07/24/2015**: General Mills Code Camp v5.0.
